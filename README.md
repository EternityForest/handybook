# handybook
Project to make a .zim file with the random handy stuff that doesn't fit on wikipedia.

Right now it's more of a template showing how to make Kiwix zim files reasonably easily.

To build, you should probably just get a precompiled image of zimwriterfs from https://download.openzim.org/release/zimwriterfs/
and stick it in /usr/bin. Then the build script should work.
